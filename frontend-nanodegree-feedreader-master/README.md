# Project Overview

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.



# Test Strategy

1. The menu
* visibility of the menu
* is hidden by default
2. RSS Feeds
* All Feeds has URL
* All Feeds has Name
* are defined
3. New Feed Selection
* changes content
4. Initial Entries
* check there is at least one element
